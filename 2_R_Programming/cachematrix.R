## The following pair of functions caches and computes the
## inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.



## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
## `cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
